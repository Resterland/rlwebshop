> requires aimeos/aimeos-typo3 extension

If installed with composer you have to downgrade to the Version 1. There is an issue with the
typo3/cms-composer-installers.

This is my extension for setting up my webshop solution based on the aimeos shop extension.

## Installation

with composer
> composer require resterland/rlwebshop
>
